# Datasets
For practicality, data sets are not included within this repository. Nonetheless, we include a direct link for downloading these sets, being the ones used for experimentation (To download datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/data or https://github.com/panambY/Hourly_Energy_Consumption/tree/master/data)
You can use any time series dataset with the following characteristics: two columns where the first is the date and the second is the variable to be predicted, in addition the dataset has to be a .csv format.
