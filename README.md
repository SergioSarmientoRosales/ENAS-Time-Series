# ENAS_Time_Series
This repository contains the necessary elements for  Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for Time Series.


This project seeks to make learning Neural Architecture Search (NAS) more accessible and understandable to a broader audience. NAS involves the use of evolutionary algorithms, which are methods inspired by natural evolution to optimize the design of neural networks. These evolutionary algorithms have different parameters that influence how the search for the most effective neural architectures for a specific task is carried out.

By democratizing NAS learning, the project aims to provide students and those interested in the field of artificial intelligence an opportunity to better understand how these evolutionary algorithms work. This includes learning about key parameters such as population size, mutation rate, crossover probability, and other factors that affect the search and optimization process.

By making this knowledge more accessible, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of Neural Architecture Search and promote its application in time series prediction. Ultimately, the goal is to train more people so they can use these algorithms effectively and contribute to the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

# Instructions

The code `NAS_FC.m` is a MATLAB file ready to be used in current versions of the software, and even in the MATLAB cloud. To start using it, you must first download the `NAS_FC.m` file along with all the recommended data sets. It is important to remember that you can use any data set for prediction, as long as the first column corresponds to the date and the second column is the variable you want to predict, and the document must be ".csv".

We recommend initially testing with the default values ​​to familiarize yourself with how the code works. Once you feel comfortable with its use, you can proceed to perform the tests and adjustments that you consider necessary to adapt it to your specific needs.

# Datasets
For practicality, data sets are not included within this repository. Nonetheless, we include a direct link for downloading these sets, being the ones used for experimentation (To download datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/data or https://github.com/panambY/Hourly_Energy_Consumption/tree/master/data)


You can use any time series dataset with the following characteristics: two columns where the first is the date and the second is the variable to be predicted, in addition the dataset has to be a .csv format.
